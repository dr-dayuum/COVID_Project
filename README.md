# COVID SQL Project

For the COVID SQL Projects I used data from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus. Main aim of this projec was to prep the data for visualisation in tableau (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dushyant4872.) The data was accessed on December 5th and since the figures for December were still updating I decided to not use that month's data in the visualisations.
